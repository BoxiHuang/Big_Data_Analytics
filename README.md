In this repository, various statistical learning models have been used to explain the underlying relationships in different case settings, such as diamond price prediction, shakespeare word recommendator and tweet polarity assessment.

## Applied Statistical Learning Models:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest (Regressor & Classifer)
4. Boosting Machine
5. K-Mean Clustering
6. Principal Componenet Analysis (PCA)

## Sampling Methods:
1. Cross-validation Sampling
2. Boostrap Sampling

These course assignments were mainly analyzed with Pyspark (Pyspark.ml library) and multiple python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas, TF-IDF. Through these assignment practices, author was able to conduct meaningful data inference and model assessments to uncover the intrinsic relationships between multiple events. The assignments showcased author's skills in data wrangling, feature engineering, bootstrap sampling, bagging, term frequency/inverse document
frequency (TF-IDF), natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis.
